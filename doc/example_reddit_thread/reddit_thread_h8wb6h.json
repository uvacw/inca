But there's a concern. I went through my cabins and found a package of these godsent snacks. There was just one but: right on the package it says \"ten minste houdbaar tot: 01-12-2018\". I crudely translated this to \"do not eat\" but still had one, as they don't look moldy or bad in anyway.\n\nThe taste was good, maybe a bit stale. There's not a single bit of mold on any of these, so I was thinking:\n\nDo these things even go bad? I would guess in correct environment, yes, but these don't look or taste bad..\n\nThe brand is Hoogvliet, if that's any help.", "depth": 0, "doctype": "reddit_post"}
